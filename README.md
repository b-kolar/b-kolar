### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm BrontÃ«, a recent graduate of the MEng Bioengineering (computational biology) program at UC Berkeley. I completed my BSc in Computer Engineering in the Netherlands at TU Delft and I'm passionate about using computer science to solve problems in biology!

#### Iâ€™m currently learning about:
- ðŸŒ± translational research
- âš¡ computational biology

#### My past projects include:
- Working on machine learning models to predict recovery outcomes for coma patients at University of California, San Francisco
- Developing tools for epigenomics research at the Genetic Identification Lab at Erasmus Medical Center
- Creating an agent-based model for predicting the spread of COVID-19 in the Netherlands with the Delft Bioinformatics Lab
- Building the low-voltage electronic system for a personal electric aircraft with Silvering Aeronautics

#### I also like to:
- Surf (mostly get hit by waves)
- Take film photos
